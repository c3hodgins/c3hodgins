- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @c3hodgins
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a student studying computer engineering interested in embedded systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VHDL in my studies, while using much of my free time to enhance my programming proficiency.
- At the moment, I am learning the basics of front-end web development, and using javascript for practicing my scripting.
- I'm looking forward to taking a class next semester on computer networking, so that I can learn some back-end web design
- and combine that with my knowledge of front-end design. I'm familiar with object oriented programming languages such as C,C++,
- but I would love to expand my abilities to more languages.
